# Lecture 1
This is just an initial impressions/cover of the class.

- There are no complex mathematics
- Pay attention
- There's a lot of detail.
- Spend 3 hours per every hour in the class

## Introduction to DOX - Design of Experiments
- Important to know about [[Experiments]]
**- What best settings is needed to get the best results form an experiment?**
- Design of eXperiments - DOX
- Prototype manufacturing is difficult; we use computer models instead.
- Poorly designed experiments produce crap

## Engineering Experiments
- Engineering experiments greatly reduces the time to market for a lot of products.
1. Reduce TIME to develop new products and processes
2. Improve performance of existing, increasing yield and reducing cycle time
3. [[Important Roles of Experiments]]

## [[Four Eras in the History of DOX]]
- DOX is widely used in other fields as well.
- Used in other disciplines, such as websites as a means to attract you to buy something, etc.

## Operational Tests
- No military system can be fully fielded until it goes through a full scale operational test.
- Test how the system performs under different conditions
- Linked to disaster that occurred with M1A1 Abrams tanks
- Has laser rangefinder, gun turret can line up with target even while it's moving.
- F35 would not land on ship! This needed to go through an operationa ltest

## William Sealy Gosset
- Developed the [[T-Test]]
- Friend of Karl Peasron and RA Fisher
- Cultivated barley for beers. 
- Karl Pearson developed Chi Square
- Gosset claims that the DOX should not just improve average yield, buit also at breeding varieties whose yield was insensitive (robust) to variation in soil and climate
