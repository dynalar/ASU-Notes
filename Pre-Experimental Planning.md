# Pre-Experimental Planning
---
1. **Recognition of and statement of a problem**
	1. This is NOT necessarily the broad big general problem, but what we expect to accomplish. This is the question we want answered.
		1. Get all key players together and in teams! Must have appropriate info about the problem.
	2. You never want to have an experiment designed by ONE person that is an EXPERT on this problem
		1. They will design a biased experiment! That's narrow in scope.
2. **Choice of factors, levels, and ranges**
	1. Are they factors we're going to vary? Hoow many levels and ranges?
	2. What factors are important? 
		1. Two levels works pretty well. 
		2. Don't do lots of factors and 4-5 levels, too expensive!
	3. Ranges - Don't make tiny changes! There's no results/tiny variance. Mostly noise.
		1. Make big changes!
3. **Selection of the response variable(s)**
	1. How are we going to measure this? What tools? Tool calibration?
