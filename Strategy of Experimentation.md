# Strategies for Experimentation
---
- ## Best Guess experiments
	- Used a lot
		- "I think the problem is temperature, lets change it and see what happens!"
	- More successfuly than you think, but there are disadvantages
	- The best guess is what we did first, but if it fails again... then what?
	- Expectations should be low for this. Not the best way to do it.
- ## One-factor-at-a-time (OFAT) experiments
	- Most engineers do lab courses with this.
	- Involves testing various factors one at a time.
	- Sometimes associated with the "scientific" or "engineering" method
	- Devastated by interaction, also VERY inefficient.
		- "Interaction" means when changing different factors, changes occur drastically with other factors
		- This is not a good idea! What if you have multiple factors that get you the result you want? You'll never know if you test one at a time
- ## Statistically designed experiments
	- Based on Fisher's Factorial Idea
	- Uses concept of [[Factorial Design]]
