- The above table shows data for a cement formula, and seeing the time it takes to cure after its been set.
- We want it to cure faster!
- Recipe was modified, polymer latex was added.
- However, did this impact bond strength???
- Testing might have been done in random order. 
- How do we display this data?
	- We can use something like this, called a [[Dot Diagram]]
	- We can also view it as a [[Histogram]]
	- [[Box Plots]] May Work Better
