# Box Plots

- This is much easier to look at. 
	- The lower edge of the box is usually the 25th percentile of the data, and top part is 75th percentile.
	- Line through the center is the median
	- The lines above and below the boxes are the "whiskers", showing maximum and minimum.
	- John Tukey created this.
	- Normal Distribution is not a bad thing here!
	- The boxes are displaced from each other by alot. 25th percentile of left side is larger than right side.
- Looking at total spread is a good idea between two plots.
- When sample sizes are small, it's more realistic.
