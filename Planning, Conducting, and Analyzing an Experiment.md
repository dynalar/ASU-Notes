---
## **There are 7 steps total.**

### First 3 steps are part of [[Pre-Experimental Planning]] stage

4. **Choice of Design**
	1. Software can do this for us, to make good decision on what design to choose.
5. **Conducting the Experiment**
	1. IF we want it done right, do it yourself.
	2. If not, be there when it runs and ask a lot of questions so people don't change anything.
	3. Always have someone on team that before every run has been started, all factors are started from the RIGHT level.
6. **Statistical Analysis**
	1. Most engineers hate this part
	2. Only way to get objective, repeatable results.
	3. Minitab and JMP makes this easy
7. **Drawing Conclusions and Recommendations**
	1. Self explanatory
	2. Make sure you present the data simply, not as pages of calculations. Images recommended.
