- Can use factorial experiments for lots of things!
*- Factorial design means that all possible combinations are tested in an experiment.*
- Golf example is up above.
- Baseball is facing something similar, home runs have been increasing!
	- Size of baseball players
	- Very fast pitches
	- Was not like this before!
- Some factors for golfing is the driver material, and this revolutionized the distance that you could hit golf balls.
- Strategy is to repeat each one of these combinations twice, and play them in random order.

	- The scores above show us the total scores we got from trying O driver with B ball, O driver with T ball, R driver with B ball, etc etc etc
	- This produces an effect; the score given of a mean from all the games.
	- But wait... lets add beverages and mode of travel!
		- As the number of factors goes up that we want to test, the bigger the experiment gets.\

		- Those are a lot of factors to test!
		- Instead, we must use [[Fractional Factorial Experiments]]
